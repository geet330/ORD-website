      <h1>FAU-G makes first addition to it’s game modes, releases the trailer</h1><br>
      <p class="mainarticle">
        Fearless and United Guards (FAU-G) was one of the most awaited games last year. It was anticipated to replace PUBG Mobile after its ban. While FAU-G was released in story mode, new game modes were promised, and TDM just happens to be the first one. A glimpse of this can be seen in the new trailer released. <br><br>

        Since FAU-G was announced around the same time PUBG was banned, the fanbase of the same was excited for the new Indian counterpart. The initial trailer of the game cleared that it has a story mode gameplay, which is based on the Galwan Valley incident. This ended all the parallels being drawn between the two games. <br><br>
        
        However, after the release, the game wasn’t as thrilling due to lack of gunfight. It has melee weapons only, and was quite disappointing for the players. This may just be about to change with the new TDM mode as this mode, for the first time ever in FAU-G, has weapons. Players can use all kinds of guns in this upcoming mode. <br><br>
        
        Recently, nCore Games tweeted the trailer of the new mode and announced a release date for TDM mode. It will be added on June 21 and can be tested out by players for a couple of months. <br><br>
        
        The tweet read, “The choice between good & evil is within us! On this auspicious day of Ram Navami, we present to u the cinematic teaser of FAU-G’s TDM Mode!  Which side are you on? <br><br><br>
        
        Beta Release–June21 <br><br><br>

        The trailer doesn’t really show any hands-on gameplay. Hence, it’ll be interesting to see what this mode has in store for players and how it’ll attract new users.
